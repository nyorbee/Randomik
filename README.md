# Randomik
With this program, you can randomly select and copy photos from one folder to another. This can be useful, for example, when you want to hang photos in a frame but want to do it completely randomly.

The available options are:

selecting the number of photos that the program will randomly select
including subfolders (the program searches for photos in subfolders as well as in the main folder, which can be time-consuming depending on the number of subfolders and files)
selecting the orientation of the photo, whether you want to randomly select only vertical or horizontal photos, or if you don't care, which is the default option.
after copying the files, cutting them and moving them to another folder, so that they do not participate in the next random selection.
Beta version. Any constructive criticism is welcome, feel free to test and provide feedback.
